# Maritime_Revolution : AI & Logistics Innovation Lab 

### Mission: The Hybrid Specialist
Bridging the gap between **BSc Nautical Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**. This lab develops data-driven solutions for maritime decarbonization, autonomous navigation, and port efficiency.
---
### Phase 1: Foundation - (Current)
* **1. Safety Net Logic (Vessel Telemetry Validator)** - Implementation of state-based logic for anchor and underway vessels.
* **2. Navigation Engine (Haversine)** - Implemented vectorized spherical trignometry to calculate Distance to go (DTG) for 1,000+ AIS data point.
* **Status:** Active

### Phase 2: Predictive Analysis (Upcoming)
* **Goal:** Developing Haversine-based Great Circle algorithms for voyage optimization and ETA prediction.

### Phase 3: Maritime Intelligence System (Target: March 15)
* **Goal** AI-Driven Port Congestion Predictor and Fuel Efficiency Model for Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) and ESG compliance.
