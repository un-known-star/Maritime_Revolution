# Maritime_Revolution : AI & Logistics Innovation Lab 

### Mission: The Hybrid Specialist
Bridging the gap between **BSc Nautical Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**. This lab develops data-driven solutions for maritime decarbonization, autonomous navigation, and port efficiency.
---
### Phase 1: Operational Safety & Logic (Current)
* **Current Focus** [Vessel Telemetry Validator](Day_1_safety_net.py) - Implementation of state-based logic for anchor and underway vessels.
* **Status:** Active

### Phase 2: Predictive navigation Engines (Upcoming)
* **Goal:** Developing Haversine-based Great Circle algorithms for voyage optimization and ETA prediction.

### Phase 3: Maritime Intelligence System (Target: March 15)
* **Goal** AI-Driven Port Congestion Predictor and Fuel Efficiency Model for Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) and ESG compliance.
---
### Progress Log
* **Feb 13 2026:** Initialized Lab. Implemented Day 1: Safety-based validation for anchored and underway vessels (Speed & Swinging Circle logic).
